Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

You can assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.

Example:<br>
Input:<br>
string = "abaxyzzyxf" <br>
Output:<br>
"xyzzyx"
