Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example:<br>
Input: <br>
array = [2, 2, 1]<br>
Output: 1

Input: <br>
array = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]<br>
Output: 4
